5. Client-side state update and redirect

### License Activation
1. User enters activation key in dashboard
2. HWID generation on client-side
3. Server validates key and binds to HWID
4. License status update in database
5. Real-time heartbeat system activation

### Software Download
1. License validation check
2. HWID verification
3. Download logging for analytics
4. Secure file serving from protected directory
